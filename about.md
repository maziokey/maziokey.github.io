An IT support specialist venturing into the vast world of web development. This blog will serve as a starting point as soon as I can wrap my head around this scribble theme I forked from [Mu-An](http://muan.co). I hope to share all my rookie experiences and occassionally, bitch about random stuff.

I already have a [wordpress](http://maxichimaximind.wordpress.com) and [Tumblr](http://maxichimaxi.tumblr.com) blog out there, but with this blog I get to use Github, thereby simultaneously learning how to use Github.

Tweet me [@okeymaxi](http://twitter.com/okeymaxi) and read my Forked codes on [GitHub](http://github.com/maziokey).

You have a nice day.
